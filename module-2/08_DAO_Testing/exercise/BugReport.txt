Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:  getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_employee

Expected output: getTimesheets should return a list of all timesheets. For example two timesheets for an id of '1'

Actual output: getTimesheets only returned one timesheet for an employee id of '1'

How did you fix this bug? I changed the if statement in method to a while loop to keep populating list


Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:getTimesheetsByProjectId_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project

Expected output: getTimesheetsByProjectId should return a list of timesheets using the projectid. For example 3 timesheets for an id of '1'

Actual output: getTimesheetsByProjectId should return a list of 3 timesheets for a projectid of '1'

How did you fix this bug? I replaced the sql statement's WHERE statement to use project id instead of employeeid.


Bug 3

Test that demonstrates problem: getBillableHours_returns_correct_total

Expected output: getBillableHours should return a sum of hours from imputed id's where billable is set to true.

Actual output: getBillableHours returned the sum of all hours even those not billable.

How did you fix this bug? I updated the WHERE clause to only retrieve those that have billable set to true.
